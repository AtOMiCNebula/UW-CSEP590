Correct EKF updates and paddle update

Appropriate number of iterations reported

Iterative EKF doesn't necessarily help with non-gaussian noise. It helps with nonlinear obesrvation and dynamics functions

Good idea averaging over multiple runs for analysis

Give more explanation for why initial covarance and noise have effect they do on performance
